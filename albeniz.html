        <span class="text-left">
          <p>Isaac Albéniz was a Spanish pianist and composer best known for his piano works based on folk music idioms. Many of his pieces such as Asturias (Leyenda), Granada, Sevilla, Cádiz, Córdoba, Cataluí±a, and the Tango in D are among the most important pieces for classical guitar.</p>
          <p>Albéniz was a child prodigy who first performed at the age of four. His concert career began at the age of nine when his father toured both Isaac and his sister, Clementina, throughout northern Spain. In 1876, after a short stay at the Leipzig Conservatory, he went to study at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. In 1883 he met the teacher and composer Felip Pedrell, who inspired him to write Spanish music such as the Chants d'Espagne. The first movement (Prelude) of that suite, later retitled after the composer's death as Asturias (Leyenda), is probably most famous today as part of the classical guitar repertoire, even though it was originally composed for piano. (Many of Albéniz's other compositions were also transcribed for guitar, notably by Francisco Tárrega.)</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Practice Tips</h2>
      <span class="text-left">
        <p>This piece is quite difficult and fun to play. Based on my experience I recommend listening to a different performance, my favorite is Ana Vidovic’s interpretation, however, there are many different viable interpretations. Hopefully, this would help give you an idea of how you wanna play it. Next is the practice, in your practice focus on balance, your thumb should be louder than your index and middle finger, as your thumb plays the melody while your index and middle fingers are sort of creating this tremolo effect. Pay attention to the score, and practice it as much as possible with a metronome, the trickiest part in my opinion occurs in bar 25-37, this section requires a lot of control and practice. One way to improve this part is playing it extremely slow, this would help your fingers get acclimated to the proper movements. The difference between a good interpretation and a bad one is so minor, and it’s not dependant on how many notes are correctly played, try to capture the spirit of Asturias in your playing.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Practice Tips</h2>
      <span class="text-left">
        <p>I haven’t been able to fully play this piece. It has nasty barres, and in my opinion, is what classical guitarists’ nightmares are made from. How does it sound so beautiful though? Let’s take a deeper look, we can see that this piece has a part A, then a part B in minor, then seemingly a transition part C, then a part A* an octave lower, then part B* again, ending on part A**. This is suggestive of a non-normal pattern of composition, nonetheless here are some guidelines for each part. Part A is in major and it’s soft or should be played softer than the rest, the tempo can be a little faster, think of it as a walk. Part B is in minor, so imagine you’re walking and you witness a car crash, not the best feeling but you’re sort of glad it’s not you, try to represent both sides of the minor, the happiness and aeolian sadness. Part C is a transition and I imagine that being like walking by the car crash fast trying not to look trying to leave it behind you. Anyway, that’s how I imagine the piece.</p>

      <span class="text-left">
        <p>The most important thing I can tell you about this piece is barre positions, start in the fifth, and keep changing bars as the piece progresses. I would say it’s a pretty easy piece and I personally love almost everything about it. Make sure you can do artificial harmonics well before attempting the opening bars, crescendo the D minor arpeggios, use the thumb to strum the chords in the C section emphasising the melodic line only, use lots of tonal colours to avoid monotony.</p>
