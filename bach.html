        <span class="text-left">
          <p>Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations, and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival, he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time.</p>
          <p>The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at age 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph, after which he continued his musical formation in Lüneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and Köthen, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St. Thomas) in Leipzig. He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Practice Tips</h2>
      <span class="text-left">
        <p>This piece is quite difficult and fun to play. Based on my experience I recommend listening to a different performance, my favorite is Ana Vidovic’s interpretation, however, there are many different viable interpretations. Hopefully, this would help give you an idea of how you wanna play it. Next is the practice, in your practice focus on balance, your thumb should be louder than your index and middle finger, as your thumb plays the melody while your index and middle fingers are sort of creating this tremolo effect. Pay attention to the score, and practice it as much as possible with a metronome, the trickiest part in my opinion occurs in bar 25-37, this section requires a lot of control and practice. One way to improve this part is playing it extremely slow, this would help your fingers get acclimated to the proper movements. The difference between a good interpretation and a bad one is so minor, and it’s not dependant on how many notes are correctly played, try to capture the spirit of Asturias in your playing.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Practice Tips</h2>
      <span class="text-left">
        <p>I haven’t been able to fully play this piece. It has nasty barres, and in my opinion, is what classical guitarists’ nightmares are made from. How does it sound so beautiful though? Let’s take a deeper look, we can see that this piece has a part A, then a part B in minor, then seemingly a transition part C, then a part A* an octave lower, then part B* again, ending on part A**. This is suggestive of a non-normal pattern of composition, nonetheless here are some guidelines for each part. Part A is in major and it’s soft or should be played softer than the rest, the tempo can be a little faster, think of it as a walk. Part B is in minor, so imagine you’re walking and you witness a car crash, not the best feeling but you’re sort of glad it’s not you, try to represent both sides of the minor, the happiness and aeolian sadness. Part C is a transition and I imagine that being like walking by the car crash fast trying not to look trying to leave it behind you. Anyway, that’s how I imagine the piece.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Practice Tips</h2>
      <span class="text-left">
        <p>The most important thing I can tell you about this piece is barre positions, start in the fifth, and keep changing bars as the piece progresses. I would say it’s a pretty easy piece and I personally love almost everything about it. Make sure you can do artificial harmonics well before attempting the opening bars, crescendo the D minor arpeggios, use the thumb to strum the chords in the C section emphasising the melodic line only, use lots of tonal colours to avoid monotony.</p>
